# This file represents a 16x16 texture for corruptor_item_fallback.png
# Since we can't create actual image files through text, you should:
# 1. Create a 16x16 pixel image in your image editor
# 2. Make it look like a small corruptor icon
# 3. Save it as corruptor_item_fallback.png in the textures/item directory
# This will be shown if the GeckoLib 3D model doesn't render properly
